released a google form 
Got 62 real responses, and the distributin are as follows
```{r}
library(readxl)
survey <- read_excel("survey_result.xlsx")
count(survey$year)
freqcy <- c(19,10,18,8,7)
lbls <- c("freshmen", "sophomores", "juniors", "seniors", "5th year or higher")
pct <- round(freqcy/sum(freqcy)*100)
lbls <- paste(lbls, pct)
lbls <- paste(lbls,"%",sep="")
pie(freq, labels=lbls, col=rainbow(length(lbls)))
```
